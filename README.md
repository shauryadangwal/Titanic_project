# Abstract:
project to find survival rate and predict who will survive based on certain parameters
By the means of parameters like Sex,age,survived i have trained my model fr prediction of who will have  survived.
It was visualized that
Sex: Females are more likely to survive.
SibSp/Parch: People traveling alone are more likely to survive.
Age: Young children are more likely to survive.
Pclass: People of higher socioeconomic class are more likely to survive.
By running this project a seperate file is created which has passenger id  and survival of particular passenger.

In this project different algorithms can be used , i have used random forest as its accuracy score was better than Gaussian naive bayes , KNN(k nearest neighbor), Decision tree.
Data analysis by considering features how complete they are is done.
Later model is fitted.
